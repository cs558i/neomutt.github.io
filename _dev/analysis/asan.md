**Note**: Running a program using ASAN will consume more memory and run more slowly than normal.

The Address Sanitizer adds compile-time options that can detect:

- Memory leaks
- Buffer overflows (and underflows)
- Out-of-bounds accesses to heap, stack and globals
- Memory use after free
- Double-free, invalid free

## Installation

First you may need to install the ASAN libraries.

- Debian: `apt-get install libasan6`
- Fedora: `dnf install libasan`

## Building

To build NeoMutt with the Address Sanitizer, you need to add a option to the compiler and linker.
The simplest way is to:

```sh
./configure --asan [OPTIONS]
make
```

Alternatively, you can specify additional build flags:

```sh
export EXTRA_CFLAGS="-fsanitize=address"
export EXTRA_LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=address"
./configure [OPTIONS]
make
```

When debugging, it may also be helpful to add:

```sh
EXTRA_CFLAGS="$EXTRA_CFLAGS -ggdb3 -O0"
```

## Address Sanitizer Options

The Address Sanitizer's behaviour can be controlled by setting an environment variable.
Multiple options should be separated with a colon `:`

**Note**: Some platforms will need to use this options to show memory leaks:

```sh
export ASAN_OPTIONS="detect_leaks=1"
```

This **highly recommended** option redirects the output to a file
(ncurses can cause the output become garbled).

This will create a file called `asan.PROCESS_ID`

```sh
export ASAN_OPTIONS="log_path=asan"
```

This option reduces the clutter in the output:

```sh
export ASAN_OPTIONS="print_legend=0"
```

Here are multiple options together, separated by colon `:`

```sh
export ASAN_OPTIONS="print_legend=0:log_path=asan"
```

## Running NeoMutt

Now, run NeoMutt as normal.

If there are no memory problems, there will be no output from the Address Sanitizer.

## Sample Output

Here's some sample output from a couple of bugs:

### Memory Leak

This shows a simple memory leak.
It shows the callstack up to the point where the memory was allocated.

```reply
==61167==ERROR: LeakSanitizer: detected memory leaks

Direct leak of 19 byte(s) in 1 object(s) allocated from:
    #0 0x7eff1fd87667 in __interceptor_malloc (/lib64/libasan.so.6+0xb0667)
    #1 0x741c95 in mutt_mem_malloc mutt/memory.c:95
    #2 0x48f089 in get_hostname /home/mutt/work/neo/init.c:343

    #5 0x7eff1ea1c041 in __libc_start_main ../csu/libc-start.c:308

SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: 19 byte(s) leaked in 1 allocation(s).
```

### Use After Free

This use-after-free example shows the callstack in three places:

- Where the memory was just accessed
- Where the memory was previously freed
- Where the memory was originally allocated
