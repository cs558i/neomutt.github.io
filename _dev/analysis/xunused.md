**xunused** is a tool to find unused C/C++ functions and methods across source
files in the whole project.
It is built upon [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) to parse the source code.

### Example

Just pass the [compilation database](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html) as an argument to `xunused`.

```sh
xunused compile_commands.json
```

```

```

**Note**: Some platforms may need an extra parameter to locate headers such as `stdbool.h`

```sh
xunused -extra-arg=-I/usr/lib/clang/17/include compile_commands.json
```

### Excluding test code

To find functions that are only used by tests but not any other code we need to exclude our test code.

In theory the `-filter` could be used for that. Unfortunately that only works
for *including* paths and not for excluding. And the underlying regular
expression engine doesn't support negative lookahead so something
like `-filter='.+^((?!test).)*$'` also doesn't help.

The easy brute force solution is to simply remove the test folder before running `xunused`.
